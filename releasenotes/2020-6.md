# v2020.6 Release Notes

This release is mainly a bug fix release, but it does add one feature.

# Feature Added

## Ability to have outline on buttons

Outline on buttons instead of full color. This can be done on a per object basis or set as a default when objects are added to the show file.

# Bug Fixing

Fixed an issue where when OSC out is enbaled on the conole, the app would crash.
Fixed an issue where scenes did not listen to button size changes.


# All Work Done

All work done for this version can be found on the [GitHub milestone](https://github.com/maeganjwilson/iHog/milestone/5?closed=1) or on the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/AB25kAVi/ihog-app).

A lot of work done in this release was to fix improvements that didn't have bugs or issues associated with it.
