# Features

## Control Show Objects

Use show objects like groups, palettes, lists, and scenes from directories like you would on a console screen.

Change object properties like the color of the box and the name of the object.

## Control the Front Panel

Use the programming buttons and the playback side. All the buttons you find on a Hog 4 console are available in the app. 90 masters can be controlled via the playback side. Also in settings, decide whether or not you are utilizing Nano Mode, a console with 4 encoders, and how precise the encoders respond.

# Your Support of Future Development

The app is a one time purchase of $1.99. I keep the cost low to make it more accessible to anyone who wants to use it. 

To maintain an app like this, I will need to test the app with each Hog 4 OS software release and each iPad OS software release. Plus there are more features Iâ€™d like to add into the app as time goes on. 

Please consider supporting future development by using the in-app purchase option or
