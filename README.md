# Your Support of Future Development

The app is a one time purchase of $1.99. I keep the cost low to make it more accessible to anyone who wants to use it. 

To maintain an app like this, I will need to test the app with each Hog 4 OS software release and each iPad OS software release. Plus there are more features Iâ€™d like to add into the app as time goes on. 

Please consider supporting future development by using the in-app purchase option or the links below.
